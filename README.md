4CE Phase 2.1 Temporal Variability Analysis in Children

## How to run this first approach?
First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/aGutierrezSacristan/temporalVariabilityAnalysis

Then open the file temporalVariability.Rmd and:
- add your site ID to the title
- change the myinputFiles to the directory where your phase 2.1 data is located
- determine the obfuscation threshold: 
    - obfuscation = FALSE if no obfuscation
    - the numeric value of the obfuscation threshold if any; e.g. obfuscation = 3
    Make sure you comment the existing obfuscation line, set up as FALSE
    

After all these changes are done, run the temporalVariability.Rmd, as an output an html file named: temporalVariability.html should be generated.
